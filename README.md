# About
This program can be described as a combination of two ChatGPT-4 instances, managed with a straightforward control structure.

Typing "quit" will exit the program and save the conversation to a JSON file. Switching between the two bots is easyâ€”just mention that you want a product suggestion. Each time you switch bots, the conversation history will also be saved in a JSON file.
